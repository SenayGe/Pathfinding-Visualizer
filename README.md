# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer
This project is a python visualization app for the A* and dijkstra's path-finding algorithms. It lets you pick a start and end node and helps you visualize the search process of finding the shortest path. Furthermore, it allows you to either manually draw walls or generate a recurssive maze in order to test the algorithms along obstacle filled paths.
